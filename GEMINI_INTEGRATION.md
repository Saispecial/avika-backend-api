## 🚀 **How the Advanced Integration Works**

### **Intelligent Response Selection**
The system intelligently chooses between Gemini AI and structured responses:

```typescript
if (stage === "emotion_followup") {
  // Use our advanced follow-up system
  response = generateEmotionFollowUp(emotion, followUpCount);
} else if (stage === "call_to_action") {
  // Use our call-to-action system  
  response = generateCallToAction(emotion, exchangeCount);
} else {
  // Use Gemini for natural conversation
  response = await getGeminiResponse(message, conversationState);
}
```

### **Enhanced Gemini Context**
Gemini receives rich context for better responses:

```typescript
const context = `You are Avika, an empathetic AI assistant focused on emotional wellness.

Context:
- Current emotion detected: ${dominantEmotion}
- Conversation stage: ${stage}
- Exchange count: ${exchangeCount}
- Previous conversation: ${conversationHistory}

Guidelines:
- Be warm, empathetic, and supportive
- Validate the user's feelings
- Ask thoughtful follow-up questions
- Keep responses concise but meaningful

User's message: "${message}"`;
```

## 🎯 **Usage Examples**

### **Advanced Gemini Chat** (Recommended)

```bash
# Enhanced chat with full AI + advanced features
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/chat-gemini-advanced \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I feel really anxious about everything",
    "sessionId": "user-123",
    "conversationHistory": ["Hello", "Hi there! How are you feeling?"]
  }'
```

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "response": "I can hear the anxiety in your words, and I want you to know that what you're feeling is completely valid. Anxiety can feel overwhelming, but you're not alone in this. What specifically has been weighing on your mind lately?",
    "emotion": "anxiety",
    "riskLevel": "medium", 
    "stage": "emotion_followup",
    "exchangeCount": 2,
    "actionType": "followup",
    "recommendations": [
      "📞 Consider calling 988 for support and guidance",
      "🧘 Try a grounding exercise: 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you feel"
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Conversation Flow with Gemini**

```typescript
// Exchange 1-2: Gemini handles natural conversation
User: "Hi, I'm not feeling great"
Gemini: "I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling great. I'm here to listen and support you. Can you tell me a bit more about what's going on?"

// Exchange 3-5: Advanced follow-ups kick in
User: "I'm just really stressed about work"
System: "I can sense you're feeling stressed. What specifically about work is causing you the most anxiety right now?" // Follow-up 1

// Exchange 8-10: Call to action triggers
User: "I just can't handle the pressure anymore"
System: "I'd like to share some self-help techniques that many people find helpful for work stress. Would you like to try a quick grounding exercise?" // Call to Action
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Conversation State Integration**
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  stage: string;                    // Current conversation stage
  exchangeCount: number;            // Triggers call-to-action at 8-10
  emotionFollowUps: number;         // Tracks follow-up questions (max 4)
  dominantEmotion: string;          // Influences Gemini context
  emotionHistory: string[];         // Provides conversation context
  callToActionTriggered: boolean;   // Prevents duplicate triggers
  lastActionType?: string;          // Rotates action types
}
```

### **Enhanced Gemini Prompting**
```typescript
const geminiContext = `You are Avika, an empathetic AI assistant.

Current Context:
- Emotion: ${state.dominantEmotion}
- Stage: ${state.stage} 
- Exchange: ${state.exchangeCount}
- History: ${conversationHistory}

Be warm, validate feelings, ask thoughtful questions.
User: "${message}"`;
```

### **Intelligent Response Routing**
```typescript
// Safety first - always override with crisis intervention
if (safety.riskLevel === "high") {
  return generateSafetyResponse();
}

// Structured responses for specific stages
if (stage === "emotion_followup") {
  return generateEmotionFollowUp(emotion, count);
}

if (stage === "call_to_action") {
  return generateCallToAction(emotion, count);
}

// Gemini for natural conversation
return await getGeminiResponse(message, state);
```
