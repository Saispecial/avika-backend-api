## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **401 Unauthorized**
- Check JWT token is valid and properly formatted
- Ensure `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is included

#### **500 Internal Server Error**
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure Supabase connection is working

#### **Gemini API Errors**
- Verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Check API key has proper permissions
- Monitor API rate limits and quotas

#### **Database Connection Issues**
- Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`
- Check network connectivity to Supabase
- Ensure database schema is properly set up
