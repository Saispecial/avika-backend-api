# Advanced Conversation Features

This document describes the enhanced conversation features implemented in the Avika Backend API.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **2-4 Emotion Follow-ups**
The system now automatically generates 2-4 follow-up questions when strong emotions are detected:

```typescript
// Example: User expresses anxiety
User: "I'm feeling really anxious about work"
Bot: "I can sense you're feeling anxious. What specifically is making you feel this way?" // Follow-up 1

User: "My boss is really demanding and I can't keep up"
Bot: "When did you first notice these anxious feelings starting?" // Follow-up 2

User: "It started about a month ago when the workload increased"
Bot: "How does this anxiety show up in your body? Do you feel it physically?" // Follow-up 3
```

### 2. **Call to Action After 8-10 Exchanges**
After 8-10 message exchanges, the system triggers specific AI actions based on the user's dominant emotion:

#### **Anxiety Actions:**
- **Self Help**: Grounding exercises, progressive muscle relaxation
- **Breathing**: 4-7-8 breathing technique, box breathing
- **Therapy**: Free 15-minute consultation recommendations
- **Content**: CBT resources, mindfulness apps, books

#### **Sadness Actions:**
- **Self Help**: Gentle movement, creative expression, connection
- **Breathing**: Heart coherence breathing, loving-kindness breathing
- **Therapy**: Depression specialists, support groups
- **Content**: Mood tracking apps, uplifting books, podcasts

#### **Anger Actions:**
- **Self Help**: Physical release, journaling, time-out techniques
- **Breathing**: Cooling breath, count-down breathing
- **Therapy**: Anger management specialists, conflict resolution
- **Content**: Assertiveness training, boundary setting resources

### 3. **Enhanced Safety Detection**
Three-tier risk assessment system:

- **High Risk**: Immediate intervention (suicide ideation, self-harm plans)
- **Medium Risk**: Concerning language (self-harm thoughts, hopelessness)
- **Low Risk**: General distress (feeling down, overwhelmed)

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Conversation State Tracking**
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  stage: string;                    // Current conversation stage
  exchangeCount: number;            // Total message exchanges
  emotionFollowUps: number;         // Number of emotion follow-ups done
  dominantEmotion: string;          // Most frequent recent emotion
  emotionHistory: string[];         // History of detected emotions
  callToActionTriggered: boolean;   // Whether CTA has been triggered
  lastActionType?: string;          // Last action type to avoid repetition
}
```

### **Advanced Flow Management**
```typescript
// Enhanced conversation progression
const newState = progressConversationAdvanced(userInput, currentState);

// Generates appropriate responses based on stage
if (newState.stage === "emotion_followup") {
  response = generateEmotionFollowUp(emotion, followUpCount);
} else if (newState.stage === "call_to_action") {
  response = generateCallToAction(emotion, exchangeCount);
}
```

### **Emotion Classification**
Enhanced keyword-based emotion detection with scoring:

```typescript
// Comprehensive emotion mapping
const emotionScores = {
  anxiety: anxietyKeywords.filter(keyword => text.includes(keyword)).length,
  sadness: sadnessKeywords.filter(keyword => text.includes(keyword)).length,
  anger: angerKeywords.filter(keyword => text.includes(keyword)).length,
  joy: joyKeywords.filter(keyword => text.includes(keyword)).length
};
```
